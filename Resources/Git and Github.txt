__________CREATING NEW REPO AND PUSH CODE INTO IT (USING HTTPS METHOD)__________
- First create new repo on github, set its name and details.
- Create .gitignore file to ignore pushing the folders/files you don't want to be pushed on github
- Now come into your project folder on pc and open git bash and run following commands, to push project for the first time:

git init
git status (optional: to check which changes were not staged)
git add .
git status (optional: to check which changes were not staged)
git commit -m "title of commit" -m "description of commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/...
git push -u origin main

- After applying new changes, you want new changes in code and files/folders to be pushed, for that open git bash in project directory and run following commands:

git status (optional)
git add .
git status (optional)
git commit -m "title of commit" -m "description of commit"
git push

_________CLONING PROJECT AND PUSH THAT PROJECT WITH NEW CODE_________
- Create new repository on github
- Clone the repository:
copy SSH link of github repo, run command: git clone (paste link of SSH)
- Now you can work in cloned repo on your computer.
- After making changes to repo, you can push code on github repo by following next steps
- Now to let git keep track record of the files in your repo you need to add those files on git by using following command:
git add .  (to add add files)
or
git add <filename> (to add single file)
- Now your files are added on git.
- Now you can check status of your files which are modified, newly added or removed files using following command:
git status
- Now to upload changes to local git, commit changes with a message and an optional description: 
git commit -m "commit message title" -m "commit message decription."
- Now to finally push changes to your repo on github run following command: git push
